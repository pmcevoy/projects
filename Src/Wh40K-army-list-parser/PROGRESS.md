# Work Journal

## Active Work

AP sign convention unification.

---

## Recently Completed

- Sub-ability rendering implemented in `_UnitCard.cshtml`.
  Both Abilities and While Leading loops now detect `•` in `ability.Text`,
  split on `\n`, and render sub-ability lines as `.sub-ability` divs with
  `.sub-ability-name` / `.sub-ability-text` spans. Flat abilities unchanged.
  Three CSS rules added to `site.css`. Build: 0 errors, 0 warnings.
- Sub-ability profile parsing implemented in `CatalogueParser.ParseProfiles`.
  Two-pass approach: Pass 1 collects standard types; Pass 2 collects non-standard
  typeNames as sub-ability groups, merging into matching parent abilities or creating
  new ones. 4 new tests added; 170 total, all passing.
- Regeneration v1 complete. Generated UI near-identical to original.
  No spec files were modified during generation — all gaps were minor.
- Sub-ability spec written and merged into `.claude/` docs.

## Spec Debt

Nothing outstanding.

## Next Session Prompt

> Paste this at the start of the next Claude Code session:

"Read CLAUDE.md and all files in .claude/. Then read PROGRESS.md for current state. The AP sign convention has been unified in the specs: AP is now a negative integer throughout, SimulationAdapter passes it unchanged, and AbilityProcessor.EffectiveSave uses `save - ap`. The code has not been updated yet — run the tests first to confirm the baseline is clean, then apply the convention change across SimWeaponProfile, AbilityProcessor, SimulationAdapter, and the AP modifier handling in the simulation request pipeline. Two new Gherkin tests were added for combat simulation - ensure they are added to the test suite."
